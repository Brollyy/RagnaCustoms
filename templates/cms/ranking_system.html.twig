      <h1 class="pt-5 pb-5">Ranking system</h1>
      <h5 class="pt-4">Ranked / Unranked</h5>
      <div class="indent">
        By default, all the new published maps are Unranked. Only maps suggested by the creators and reviewed by the moderation team can become Ranked.<br>
        When map becomes Ranked, all of its levels of difficulty become Ranked at the same time and players can start earning PP scores on all of them.<br>
        PP Scoring system (which is explained below in more detail) is only used for the global leaderboard, as the normal scoring (distance based) is already great for individual maps.
      </div>

      <h5 class="pt-4">Q: Can I propose a map I made to be Ranked ?</h5>
      <div class="indent">
        It is possible to propose a map you made (or was one of the mappers on) to be Ranked.<br>
        Go to the <a href="{{ url("acceptance_criteria") }}" target="">acceptance criteria</a> page to know which
        criteria are mandatory for a map to be accepted.<br>
        Once you have read the acceptance criteria, you can submit your map by filling out the <a
            href="https://www.shorturl.at/fmBHR" target="_blank">following form </a>.<br>
        The team will then check if the map follows the acceptance criteria and mark it as Ranked if everything is ok.<br>
        <b>Remember!</b> If there were other mappers working on the song, make sure you get their consent before submitting the form. 
      </div>

      <h5 class="pt-4">Q: How to identify a ranked level ?</h5>
      <div class="indent">
        Ranked levels are identified with a star symbol : <img src="{{ asset('apps/ranked_symbol.jpg') }}"
                                                               alt="ranked map"/><br>
        Non ranked levels are identified with a circle symbol : <img src="{{ asset('apps/unranked_symbol.jpg') }}"
                                                                     alt="unranked map"/>
      </div>

      <h5 class="pt-4">Q: Why is there more than one Leaderboard ?</h5>
      <div class="indent">
        As Ragnar√∂ck had a version of the game released on Steam that allows players to play without VR (<i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> - called VoT or "flat" in the community),<br>
        which has drastically different control scheme, we decided to split the leaderboards between those players.<br>
        Later on, additional leaderboard was created for OKOD (One-Key-One-Drum), even more simplified control scheme for the flat version.<br>
        In contrast, all the different VR platforms (<i class="fas fa-vr-cardboard"></i> - Steam, Oculus Quest, Vive, etc.) share a single leaderboard, as the differences between these platforms are miniscule.<br>
        <br>
        A single player can set different scores on different leaderboards and their placement on each one is decided using only scores achieved on specific platform.
      </div>

      <h5 class="pt-4">Q: How is the PP score calculated ?</h5>
      <div class="indent">
        Performance Points (abbreviated as PP) are a ranking measure that aims to be more contextually relevant to a
        player's progression.<br>
        This system seeks to emphasize a representation of the player's skills rather than a representation of their
        play time.<br>
        It also aims to prevent overly skilled players from grinding maps that are too easy for them for points, by giving better rewards for improvements on harder maps.<br>
        
        <br>

        <h5>Raw PP</h5><br>
        Each level of difficulty of a Ranked map will grant players a number of Raw PP for their score.<br>
        This number is determined based solely on the distance achieved on a given map, with each map having different scaling based on a number of factors.<br>
        Scoring begins at 0 PP, for a distance that basically means missing ALL of the notes, then ramping up slowly until reaching 100 PP.<br>
        Afterwards, each improvement gives exponentially more PP. In general, we expect the best players to reach around 500-600 PP on easy maps and potentially even more on hard maps.<br>

        On each Ranked map page, there's a chart icon (like this: <i class="fas fa-chart-simple text-danger"></i>), 
        which opens an interactive preview of this curve, with all the player scores marked for comparison:<br>
        <img src="{{ asset('apps/pp_curve.png') }}" alt="PP curve"></img><br>
        
        <br>

        <h5>Weighted PP and Total PP</h5><br>
        To avoid having to play all Ranked maps to stay competitive, the Raw PP scores obtained by players are weighted before summing them up.<br>
        First, all of their scores are sorted in descending order of Raw PP, and then multiplied by decreasing weights in the form of 0.965^(x-1) to achieve Weighted PP.<br>
        Total PP score will be the sum of all the Weighted PP and is the value visible on the <a href="{{ url('score_global_ranking') }}">Leaderboard</a> page.<br>
        <br>
        For instance:<br><br>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>
              #

            <th>
              Weighted PP
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              1
            </td>

            <td>
              100 % of weighted PP = 321
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              2
            </td>
            <td>

            <td>
              256
            </td>
            <td>
              96.5% of weighted PP = 247
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              3
            </td>
            <td>
              Beatmap 3
            </td>
            <td>
              2456
            </td>
            <td>
              155
            </td>
            <td>
              93.1 % of weighted PP = 144.31
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        <b>Total PP</b> = 321 + 247 + 144.31 = 712.31<br><br>

        Due to this weighting process, when improving the score on a particular beatmap, players can see their Total PP increase by a lower amount than the Raw PP increase.<br>
        This is an intended consequence of this system and will <b>NEVER</b> cause the player to lose Total PP if they improved their score.
      </div>

      <h5 class="pt-4">Q: This is a lot to take in, is there any summary I can check without doing all the math ?</h5>
      <div class="indent">
        Yes! On the <a href="{{ url('score_global_ranking') }}">Leaderboard</a> page, you will this icon next to each player: <i class="fas fa-chart-simple"></i>.<br>
        It leads to a page with ranking stats for the selected player and leaderboard, displaying:
        <ul>
          <li>distribution of Raw PP scores across all played beatmaps</li>
          <li>a list of all Raw PP and Weighted PP scores (with the possibility to open the PP preview window for a specific beatmap as well)</li>
          <li>a list of Ranked maps without any score</li>
        </ul>
        You can change which Leaderboard you're viewing the statistics for, by clicking on one of the icons next to the PP distribution graph.
